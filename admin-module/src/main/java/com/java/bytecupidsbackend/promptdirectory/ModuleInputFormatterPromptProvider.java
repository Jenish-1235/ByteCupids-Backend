                "Instructions:\n" +
                "1. Extract Information Accurately:\n" +
                "   - Parse the module name and all valid metadata fields, even if phrased informally.\n" +
                "   - Normalize field names and values to match the output schema.\n" +
                "\n" +
                "2. Standardize Metadata:\n" +
                "   - Condense verbose audience descriptions (e.g., \"newbies in marketing\") into short phrases (e.g., \"Beginner marketers\").\n" +
                "   - Accept difficulty as Beginner, Intermediate, or Advanced only.\n" +

                "3. Handle Keywords:\n" +
                "   - Accept raw keyword input only for reference.\n" +
                "   - Regenerate the final keyword list by deeply analyzing the full metadata, module name, and inferred scope.\n" +
                "   - The list must help downstream AI agents generate detailed topics, subtopics, and curricula.\n" +
                "   - Include granular, domain-specific terms. Avoid vague/general words like \"course\", \"learning\", or \"etc.\".\n" +
                "   - The final list should act as a seed for full topic decomposition.\n" +

                "4. Consolidate Extra Info:\n" +
                "   - Move all unstructured or extra fields (e.g., instructor name, version, lesson count) into other_metadata using \"key: value\" format, comma-separated.\n" +
                "\n" +
                "5. Add Contextual Agent Notes:\n" +
                "   - Document any missing fields, assumptions made (e.g., estimated hours), or suggestions for future input improvement.\n" +
                "\n" +
                "6. Interpret and Summarize:\n" +

                "* Ensure clarity, completeness, and non-repetition\n" +
                "* Avoid injecting new topics or content not supported by input\n" +

                "Output Quality Priority (Descending):\n" +
                "1. Valid JSON structure\n" +
                "2. Accurate field mapping and standardization\n" +
                "3. Domain neutrality (works for any course)\n" +
                "4. Factual summarization and assumption transparency\n" +
